# Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, Eric Evans

## Preface

* Lots of talk about "domain" without actually defining the term. Is it defined in a previous section?
* Assumes the following agile practices
    1. Development is iterative
    2. Developers and domain experts have a close relationship

## I: Putting the Domain Model to Work

* Defines "domain"
* "The model and the heart of the design shape each other" cf. Types, Good Design and Yahtzee

## One: Crunching Knowledge

* The design comes from synthesis between domain experts and developers
* "When an unneeded concept was tied to one that was needed, a new model was found that distinguished the essential concept so that the other could be dropped." Remove harmful coupling
* Waterfall "fails because it completely lacks feedback. The analysts have full responsibility for creating the model, based only on input from the business experts. They have no opportunity to learn from the programmers" feedback loops should be tight and knowledge should flow in both directions
* "powerful new features unfold as corollaries to older features"
